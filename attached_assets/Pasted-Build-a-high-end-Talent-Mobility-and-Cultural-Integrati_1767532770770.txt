Build a high-end Talent Mobility and Cultural Integration platform called BridgeVantage.

1. DATABASE & 10-PERSON DATASET: Create a PostgreSQL database and seed it with exactly these 10 records:

Robert: Dept: 'Legacy Ops', Tenure: 18y, Level: 3, Skills: {Mechanical: 9, Precision: 9, IoT: 2}, Risk: 'Underutilized'.

Maya: Dept: 'Automation', Tenure: 2y, Level: 6, Skills: {AI: 9, Python: 8, Domain_Wisdom: 3}, Risk: 'Needs Context'.

Elena: Dept: 'Legacy Ops', Tenure: 22y, Level: 4, Skills: {QA: 10, Safety: 9}, Risk: 'High Flight Risk'.

James: Dept: 'Digital Sys', Tenure: 1y, Level: 4, Skills: {Cloud: 8, Security: 7}.

David: Dept: 'Automation', Tenure: 4y, Level: 5, Skills: {Robotics: 8, Legacy_Mechanics: 6}.

Sarah: Dept: 'Digital Sys', Tenure: 3y, Level: 3, Skills: {Analytics: 7, UX: 6}.

Frank: Dept: 'Legacy Ops', Tenure: 15y, Level: 2, Skills: {Tooling: 9}.

Chloe: Dept: 'Automation', Tenure: 1y, Level: 3, Skills: {Design: 8}.

Tom: Dept: 'Digital Sys', Tenure: 8y, Level: 5, Skills: {Cyber: 9}.

Lisa: Dept: 'Legacy Ops', Tenure: 12y, Level: 3, Skills: {Supply_Chain: 8}.

2. THE UI SHELL & ROLE SWITCHER:

Navigation: Fixed sidebar with 'Dashboard' and 'Skill Map'.

The Switcher: In the top-right corner of the header, place two clearly labeled toggle buttons: [View as Employee: Robert] and [View as Talent Manager].

Switching roles should instantly swap the dashboard widgets without a full page reload (use conditional rendering).

3. VIEW A: EMPLOYEE (Robert's Perspective):

Skill Radar: A Chart.js radar showing Robert's high legacy skills vs. low digital skills.

Edit My Profile: A form to update 'Digital Literacy' and 'Career Goals'.

The Bridge: A list of 'Reverse Mentorship' recommendations.

Logic: Pair Robert with high-level Automation leads. Show a match score based on (Tenure Difference * 0.4) + (Digital Skill Gap * 0.6).

4. VIEW B: TALENT MANAGER (Intelligence Dashboard):

Retention Heatmap: A visual grid of the 10 employees.

Color 'Red' if the employee is a high-performer (Skills > 8) but stagnant (Level < 4).

Color 'Amber' if Tenure > 15y but Level < 4 (The 'Wisdom Gap').

Cultural Sync List: Display the top 3 recommended 'Senior-Junior' pairings for the whole company.

Silo-Breaker Search: A search bar to find skills across the different departments.

5. DESIGN:

Theme: Clean, modern SaaS. Navy Blue (#0A192F), White cards with soft shadows, and Electric Blue accents.

Ensure that when Robert's profile is edited, the Talent Manager's Heatmap updates the risk scores instantly."
